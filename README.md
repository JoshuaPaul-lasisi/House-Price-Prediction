# House Price Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting house prices using various regression models. The goal is to evaluate model performance and identify the optimal model for accurate predictions.

## Objectives
- Clean and preprocess the housing data.
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand feature relationships.
- Develop and evaluate multiple regression models.
- Determine the best-performing model based on metrics like MSE and RÂ².

## Dataset
The dataset contains housing information from the western United States, including features such as median income, total rooms, and ocean proximity.

## Key Insights
- Gradient Boosting Regressor provided the best balance of accuracy and efficiency.
- Random Forest Regressor also performed well but had a longer runtime.
- Analysis of feature correlations and distributions helped in understanding the factors influencing house prices.

## Technologies Used
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Regression Analysis
